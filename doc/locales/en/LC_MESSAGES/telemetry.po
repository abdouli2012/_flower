#: ../../source/telemetry.md:31
msgid ""
"**Flower version.** Understand which versions of Flower are currently "

"the bandwidth to build new features."

"**Python version.** Knowing the Python version helps us, for example, to "

"features."

"**Execution mode.** Knowing what execution mode Flower starts in enables "
"us to understand how heavily certain features are being used and better "

"**Cluster.** Flower telemetry assigns a random in-memory cluster ID each "
"time a Flower workload starts. This allows us to understand which device "
"types not only start Flower workloads but also successfully complete "
"them."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/telemetry.md:43
msgid ""
"**Source.** Flower telemetry tries to store a random source ID in "
"`~/.flwr/source` the first time a telemetry event is generated. The "
"source ID is important to identify whether an issue is recurring or "
"whether an issue is triggered by multiple clusters running concurrently "
"(which often happens in simulation). For example, if a device runs "
"multiple workloads at the same time, and this results in an issue, then, "
"in order to reproduce the issue, multiple workloads must be started at "
"the same time."

"You may delete the source ID at any time. If you wish for all events "
