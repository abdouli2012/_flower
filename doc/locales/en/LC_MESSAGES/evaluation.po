"There are two main approaches to evaluating models in federated learning "
"systems: centralized (or server-side) evaluation and federated (or "
"client-side) evaluation."

#: ../../source/evaluation.rst:12
msgid ""
"All built-in strategies support centralized evaluation by providing an "
"evaluation function during initialization. An evaluation function is any "
"function that can take the current global model parameters as input and "
"return evaluation results:"

#: ../../source/evaluation.rst:59
msgid ""
"The :code:`Strategy` abstraction provides a method called "
":code:`evaluate` that can directly be used to evaluate the current global"
" model parameters. The current server implementation calls "
":code:`evaluate` after parameter aggregation and before federated "
"evaluation (see next paragraph)."

msgid "Configuring Federated Evaluation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/evaluation.rst:102
msgid ""
"Federated evaluation can be configured from the server side. Built-in "
"strategies support the following arguments:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/evaluation.rst:104
msgid ""
":code:`fraction_evaluate`: a :code:`float` defining the fraction of "
"clients that will be selected for evaluation. If "
":code:`fraction_evaluate` is set to :code:`0.1` and :code:`100` clients "
"are connected to the server, then :code:`10` will be randomly selected "
"for evaluation. If :code:`fraction_evaluate` is set to :code:`0.0`, "
"federated evaluation will be disabled."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/evaluation.rst:105
msgid ""
":code:`min_evaluate_clients`: an :code:`int`: the minimum number of "
"clients to be selected for evaluation. If :code:`fraction_evaluate` is "
"set to :code:`0.1`, :code:`min_evaluate_clients` is set to 20, and "
":code:`100` clients are connected to the server, then :code:`20` clients "
"will be selected for evaluation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/evaluation.rst:106
msgid ""
":code:`min_available_clients`: an :code:`int` that defines the minimum "
"number of clients which need to be connected to the server before a round"
" of federated evaluation can start. If fewer than "
":code:`min_available_clients` are connected to the server, the server "
"will wait until more clients are connected before it continues to sample "
"clients for evaluation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/evaluation.rst:107
msgid ""
":code:`on_evaluate_config_fn`: a function that returns a configuration "
"dictionary which will be sent to the selected clients. The function will "
"be called during each round and provides a convenient way to customize "
"client-side evaluation from the server side, for example, to configure "
"the number of validation steps performed."
