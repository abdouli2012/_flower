    "### DP-FedAvg Modification\n",
    "Originally proposed by McMahan, H. Brendan, et al.,\"Learning differentially private recurrent language models\". DP-FedAvg, has been extended by [Andrew et al. 2021, Differentially Private Learning with Adaptive Clipping](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03871), is essentially FedAvg with the following modifications:\n",
    "\n",
    "To guarantee DP at a user-level, we need to apply the following modification in our Federated Averaging algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Clipping:**, the clients' model updates must be clipped before transmission to the server, bounding the maximum influence of any one client. Moreover, knowing that the distribution of the update norm has been shown to vary from task-to-task and to evolve as training progresses. Therefore, we will use an adaptive approach of [Andrew et al. 2021, Differentially Private Learning with Adaptive Clipping](#dp-fedavg-modification) that continuously adjusts the clipping threshold to track a prespecified quantile of the update norm distribution.\n",
    " - **Noising:** Gaussian noise must be added by either the server or the clients. Adding noise could degrade the utility of the model, but we can control it using   the standard deviation of the Gaussian noise added to the sum, and the number of sampled clients at each round.\n",
    " >>>> *We provide users with the flexibility to set up the training such that each client independently adds a small amount of noise to the clipped update, with the result that simply aggregating the noisy updates is equivalent to the explicit addition of noise to the non-noisy aggregate at the server.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " > *Remarks:* In order to do this, we need first to determine how much noise the model can tolerate with the chosed number of clients (relatively small) per round with fair loss to the model utility. We will eventually train the final model with an increased amount of noise with proportional increased number of clients. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Simplifying assumptions for the training process\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that the training process realises the $(\\epsilon, \\delta )$-guarantees at the user-level, we made the following assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "-**Fixed-size subsampling** :Fixed-size subsamples of the clients must be taken at each round, as opposed to variable-sized Poisson subsamples.\n",
    "\n",
    "-**Unweighted averaging** : The contributions from all the clients must weighted equally in the aggregate to eliminate the requirement for the server to know in advance the sum of the weights of all clients available for selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "-**No client failures** : The set of available clients must stay constant across all rounds of training. In other words, clients cannot drop out or fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " >*Note:* The dataset should be large enough to support the selected number of clients. It is also important to note that since we are using an adaptative clipping, and the noise multiplier being the ratio of the noise standard deviation to the clipping norm; therefore the magnitude of the noise will change from rounds to rounds. \n",
    " >>*The above assumptions are in line with the contraints imposed by [Andrew et al.](#dp-fedavg-modification)*"
