# FedPara: Low-rank Hadamard Product for Communication-Efficient Federated Learning 

> Note: If you use this baseline in your work, please remember to cite the original authors of the paper as well as the Flower paper.

**Paper:** [openreview.net/forum?id=d71n4ftoCBy](https://openreview.net/forum?id=d71n4ftoCBy)

****Authors:****  Nam Hyeon-Woo, Moon Ye-Bin, Tae-Hyun Oh

****Abstract:**** In this work, we propose a communication-efficient parameterization, FedPara,
for federated learning (FL) to overcome the burdens on frequent model uploads
and downloads. Our method re-parameterizes weight parameters of layers using
low-rank weights followed by the Hadamard product. Compared to the conventional low-rank parameterization, our FedPara method is not restricted to lowrank constraints, and thereby it has a far larger capacity. This property enables to
achieve comparable performance while requiring 3 to 10 times lower communication costs than the model with the original layers, which is not achievable by
the traditional low-rank methods. The efficiency of our method can be further improved by combining with other efficient FL optimizers. In addition, we extend
our method to a personalized FL application, pFedPara, which separates parameters into global and local ones. We show that pFedPara outperforms competing
personalized FL methods with more than three times fewer parameters. Project

## About this baseline

****Whatâ€™s implemented:****  The code in this directory replicates the experiments in FedPara paper implementing the Low-rank scheme for Convolution module inspired by the [author's code]( https://github.com/South-hw/FedPara_ICLR22).

Specifically, it replicates the results for Cifar10 and Cifar100 in Figure 3 and the results for Feminist in Figure 5(a).


****Datasets:****  CIFAR10, CIFAR100, FEMNIST from PyTorch's Torchvision

****Hardware Setup:**** The experiment has been conducted on our server with the following specs:

- **GPU:** 1 Tesla V100 GPU 32GB VRAM
- **CPU:** 1x24 cores Intel Xeon(R) 6248R
- **RAM:** 150 GB

## Experimental Setup

****Task:****  Image classification

****Model:****  This directory implements Vgg16 with group normalization.

****Dataset:**** 

In IID settings:

| Dataset  | #classes | #partitions |  partitioning method   |
|:---------|:--------:|:-----------:|:----------------------:|
| Cifar10  |    10    |     100     | random split |
| Cifar100 |   100    |     50     | randpm split|

In non-IID settings:

| Dataset  | #classes | #partitions |  partitioning method   |
|:---------|:--------:|:-----------:|:----------------------:|
| Cifar10  |    10    |     100     | Dirichlet distribution |
| Cifar100 |   100    |     50     | Dirichlet distribution |


****Training Hyperparameters:**** 

For Dataset:
Choice of alpha parameter for the Dirichlet distribution used to create heterogeneity in the client datasets for CIFAR

| Description | Default Value |
|-------------|---------------|
| alpha       | 0.5           |


## Environment Setup

:warning: _The Python environment for all baselines should follow these guidelines in the `EXTENDED_README`. Specify the steps to create and activate your environment. If there are any external system-wide requirements, please include instructions for them too. These instructions should be comprehensive enough so anyone can run them (if non standard, describe them step-by-step)._


## Running the Experiments

:warning: _Provide instructions on the steps to follow to run all the experiments._
```bash  
# The main experiment implemented in your baseline using default hyperparameters (that should be setup in the Hydra configs) should run (including dataset download and necessary partitioning) by executing the command:

poetry run python -m <baseline-name>.main <no additional arguments> # where <baseline-name> is the name of this directory and that of the only sub-directory in this directory (i.e. where all your source code is)

# If you are using a dataset that requires a complicated download (i.e. not using one natively supported by TF/PyTorch) + preprocessing logic, you might want to tell people to run one script first that will do all that. Please ensure the download + preprocessing can be configured to suit (at least!) a different download directory (and use as default the current directory). The expected command to run to do this is:

poetry run python -m <baseline-name>.dataset_preparation <optional arguments, but default should always run>

# It is expected that you baseline supports more than one dataset and different FL settings (e.g. different number of clients, dataset partitioning methods, etc). Please provide a list of commands showing how these experiments are run. Include also a short explanation of what each one does. Here it is expected you'll be using the Hydra syntax to override the default config.

poetry run python -m <baseline-name>.main  <override_some_hyperparameters>
.
.
.
poetry run python -m <baseline-name>.main  <override_some_hyperparameters>
```


## Expected Results

:warning: _Your baseline implementation should replicate several of the experiments in the original paper. Please include here the exact command(s) needed to run each of those experiments followed by a figure (e.g. a line plot) or table showing the results you obtained when you ran the code. Below is an example of how you can present this. Please add command followed by results for all your experiments._

```bash
# it is likely that for one experiment you need to sweep over different hyperparameters. You are encouraged to use Hydra's multirun functionality for this. This is an example of how you could achieve this for some typical FL hyperparameteres

poetry run python -m <baseline-name>.main --multirun num_client_per_round=5,10,50 dataset=femnist,cifar10
# the above command will run a total of 6 individual experiments (because 3client_configs x 2datasets = 6 -- you can think of it as a grid).

[Now show a figure/table displaying the results of the above command]

# add more commands + plots for additional experiments.
```
