# :warning: FedBN: Federated Learning on Non-IID Features via Local Batch Normalization

> Note: If you use this baseline in your work, please remember to cite the original authors of the paper as well as the Flower paper.


**Paper:** [arxiv.org/abs/2102.07623](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07623)

**Authors:** Xiaoxiao Li, Meirui Jiang, Xiaofei Zhang, Michael Kamp, Qi Dou

**Abstract:** The emerging paradigm of federated learning (FL) strives to enable collaborative training of deep models on the network edge without centrally aggregating raw data and hence improving data privacy. In most cases, the assumption of independent and identically distributed samples across local clients does not hold for federated learning setups. Under this setting, neural network training performance may vary significantly according to the data distribution and even hurt training convergence. Most of the previous work has focused on a difference in the distribution of labels or client shifts. Unlike those settings, we address an important problem of FL, e.g., different scanners/sensors in medical imaging, different scenery distribution in autonomous driving (highway vs. city), where local clients store examples with different distributions compared to other clients, which we denote as feature shift non-iid. In this work, we propose an effective method that uses local batch normalization to alleviate the feature shift before averaging models. The resulting scheme, called FedBN, outperforms both classical FedAvg, as well as the state-of-the-art for non-iid data (FedProx) on our extensive experiments. These empirical results are supported by a convergence analysis that shows in a simplified setting that FedBN has a faster convergence rate than FedAvg.


## About this baseline

**What’s implemented:** Figure 3 in the paper: convergence in training loss comparing `FedBN` to `FedAvg` for five datasets.

**Datasets:** :warning: *_List the datasets you used (if you used a medium to large dataset, >10GB please also include the sizes of the dataset)._*

**Hardware Setup:** :warning: *_Give some details about the hardware (e.g. a server with 8x V100 32GB and 256GB of RAM) you used to run the experiments for this baseline. Someone out there might not have access to the same resources you have so, could list the absolute minimum hardware needed to run the experiment in a reasonable amount of time ? (e.g. minimum is 1x 16GB GPU otherwise a client model can’t be trained with a sufficiently large batch size). Could you test this works too?_*

**Contributors:** :warning: *_let the world know who contributed to this baseline. This could be either your name, your name and affiliation at the time, or your GitHub profile name if you prefer. If multiple contributors signed up for this baseline, please list yourself and your colleagues_*


## Experimental Setup

**Task:** :warning: *_what’s the primary task that is being federated? (e.g. image classification, next-word prediction). If you have experiments for several, please list them_*

**Model:** :warning: *_provide details about the model you used in your experiments (if more than use a list). If your model is small, describing it as a table would be :100:. Some FL methods do not use an off-the-shelve model (e.g. ResNet18) instead they create your own. If this is your case, please provide a summary here and give pointers to where in the paper (e.g. Appendix B.4) is detailed._*

**Dataset:** :warning: *_Earlier you listed already the datasets that your baseline uses. Now you should include a breakdown of the details about each of them. Please include information about: how the dataset is partitioned (e.g. LDA with alpha 0.1 as default and all clients have the same number of training examples; or each client gets assigned a different number of samples following a power-law distribution with each client only instances of 2 classes)? if  your dataset is naturally partitioned just state “naturally partitioned”; how many partitions there are (i.e. how many clients)? Please include this an all information relevant about the dataset and its partitioning into a table._*

**Training Hyperparameters:** :warning: *_Include a table with all the main hyperparameters in your baseline. Please show them with their default value._*


## Environment Setup

To construct the Python environment, simply run:

```bash
# Set directory to use python 3.10 (install with `pyenv install <version>` if you don't have it)
pyenv local 3.10.6

# Tell poetry to use python3.10
poetry env use 3.10.6

# Install
poetry install
```

Before running the experiments you'll need to download the five datasets for this baseline. We'll be using the pre-processed datasets created by the `FedBN` authors. Download the dataset from [here](https://mycuhk-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/1155149226_link_cuhk_edu_hk/EV1YgHfFC4RKjw06NL4JMdgBMU21CegM12SpXrSmGjt3XA?e=XK2rFs) and move the file into a new directory named `data`.
```bash
mkdir data
mv <path/to/your/digit_dataset.zip> data/

# now uncompress the zipfile
cd data && unzip digit_dataset.zip
cd data ..
```

## Running the Experiments

First, activate your environment 

:warning: _Provide instructions on the steps to follow to run all the experiments._
```bash  
# The main experiment implemented in your baseline using default hyperparameters (that should be setup in the Hydra configs) should run (including dataset download and necessary partitioning) by executing the command:

poetry run python -m <baseline-name>.main <no additional arguments> # where <baseline-name> is the name of this directory and that of the only sub-directory in this directory (i.e. where all your source code is)

# If you are using a dataset that requires a complicated download (i.e. not using one natively supported by TF/PyTorch) + preprocessing logic, you might want to tell people to run one script first that will do all that. Please ensure the download + preprocessing can be configured to suit (at least!) a different download directory (and use as default the current directory). The expected command to run to do this is:

poetry run python -m <baseline-name>.dataset_preparation <optional arguments, but default should always run>

# It is expected that you baseline supports more than one dataset and different FL settings (e.g. different number of clients, dataset partitioning methods, etc). Please provide a list of commands showing how these experiments are run. Include also a short explanation of what each one does. Here it is expected you'll be using the Hydra syntax to override the default config.

poetry run python -m <baseline-name>.main  <override_some_hyperparameters>
.
.
.
poetry run python -m <baseline-name>.main  <override_some_hyperparameters>
```

## Limitations

dataset-number of clients relationship

## Expected Results

:warning: _Your baseline implementation should replicate several of the experiments in the original paper. Please include here the exact command(s) needed to run each of those experiments followed by a figure (e.g. a line plot) or table showing the results you obtained when you ran the code. Below is an example of how you can present this. Please add command followed by results for all your experiments._

```bash
# it is likely that for one experiment you need to sweep over different hyperparameters. You are encouraged to use Hydra's multirun functionality for this. This is an example of how you could achieve this for some typical FL hyperparameteres

poetry run python -m <baseline-name>.main --multirun num_client_per_round=5,10,50 dataset=femnist,cifar10
# the above command will run a total of 6 individual experiments (because 3client_configs x 2datasets = 6 -- you can think of it as a grid).

[Now show a figure/table displaying the results of the above command]

# add more commands + plots for additional experiments.
```
