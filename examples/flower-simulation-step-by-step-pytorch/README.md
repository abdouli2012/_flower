This directory contains the code developed in the `Flower Simulation` tutorial series on Youtube. You can find all the videos [here]().

* In `Part-I` (7 videos) we developed from scratch a complete Federated Learning pipeline for simulation using PyTorch.
* In `Part-II` (2 videos) we _enhanced_ the code in `Part-I` by making a better use of Hydra configs.
