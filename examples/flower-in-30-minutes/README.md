# 30-minute tutorial running Flower simulation with PyTorch

This README links to a Jupyter notebook that you can either download and run locally or [![open it in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/adap/flower/blob/main/examples/flower-in-30-minutes/tutorial.ipynb). This is a short 30-minute (or less!) tutorial showcasing the basics of Flower federated learning simulations using PyTorch.
